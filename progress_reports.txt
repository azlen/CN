Progress Report #2

Quick reminder: what are you building, in a sentence?

Cross-platform app for learning to read/write Chinese and Japanese characters.

Here’s what you planned to do this week: 
“By the end of next week I will have all of the core features of the app in place. The app will introduce new characters in an optimal order (based on a scientific paper I have been reading -> https://tinyurl.com/y7l3ebfq ) and have exercises to both learn and practice writing.”

What did you accomplish this week? Did you do everything you planned?

Last week I designed the app's layout, this week I implemented the core features

- Exercises arranged in optimal order based on scientific paper
- Animated stroke order, radical decomposition, example sentences
- Recruited 13 future alpha testers

What do you want to have done by the end of next week?

By the end of next week I am planning on sending the app to my alpha testers so that I can recieve and act upon their feedback in week #4. This first may involve adding menus, login system, and other features to make the app more usable and customizable.


For next week I will prepare the app to be ready for alpha testing! I will be implementing new features (options menu, pronunciations, and tutorial) and polishing up the core systems.

By week #4, I'm planning to release the first alpha version and begin collecting user feedback!
